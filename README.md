The shell design is the graphical user interface of your desktop environment. It consists of the panels, menus, windows, and other visual elements that users interact with. To develop the shell design, you can use the Qt toolkit, which is a popular toolkit for developing graphical user interfaces on Linux. 

Here are some key concepts and components of the Qt toolkit that you may find useful for designing the shell:

- Widgets: Qt provides a wide range of widgets that you can use to build your shell, such as buttons, labels, progress bars, and text boxes. Each widget has its own properties and signals that you can customize and handle to achieve the desired behavior.

- Layouts: Qt provides several layout managers that you can use to position and size your widgets, such as boxes, grids, and flows. Each layout manager has its own rules and options that you can use to achieve the desired layout.

- Styling: Qt provides a flexible theming system that you can use to customize the appearance of your widgets, such as colors, fonts, and borders. You can use CSS-like syntax and selectors to apply styles to specific widgets or groups of widgets.

- Events: Qt provides a comprehensive event system that you can use to handle user input and other events, such as button clicks, key presses, and window resizing. You can connect signals to your widgets and define callback functions to respond to events.

To get started with Qt, you may want to check out the official documentation and tutorials, such as:

- Qt Documentation: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/
- Qt Tutorials: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html

You can also find many examples and resources on the internet, such as:

- Qt Examples: https://github.com/qt/qtbase/tree/dev/examples/widgets
- Qt Themes: https://www.qt.io/qt-for-application-development/theme-gallery
- Qt Applications: https://github.com/topics/qt-application

By using these resources and experimenting with different widgets, layouts, styles, and events, you can create a shell design that suits your needs and preferences.
